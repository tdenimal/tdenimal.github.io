In the following article, i will show how to install and use [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro), an open source Python library that will simplify and clarify the way to define data pipelines for your projects. 

Then we will create a project and a custom kedro dataset 
 

# Install kedro

First create a new  conda virtual environment :
kedro is compatible with python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 versions. Here i choosed 3.7.
```bash
conda create -n kedro_project python=3.7
```

Then activate it
```bash
conda activate kedro_project
```

Install kedro from conda-forge repository:


```bash
conda install -c conda-forge kedro
```

Install also kedro-viz plugin, very usefull to display your data pipelines:

## Install kedro-viz plugin

```bash
pip install kedro-viz
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kedro info

 _            _
| | _____  __| |_ __ ___
| |/ / _ \/ _` | '__/ _ \
|   <  __/ (_| | | | (_) |
|_|\_\___|\__,_|_|  \___/
v0.16.2

kedro allows teams to create analytics
projects. It is developed as part of
the Kedro initiative at QuantumBlack.

Installed plugins:
kedro_viz: 3.4.0 (hooks:global,line_magic)

```

# Create your Data Science project directory

We are going to create our datascience project directory using Kedro. It will initialize all the needed directories using a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template.

First go to the directory where you're used to create your projects repos ( mine is /home/tdenimal/Dev )

```bash
cd /home/tdenimal/Dev
```

Then create project and choose the project name,  leave the other choices at their default value.
I choosed pneumothorax, to create the project directory for the [following work](https://tdenimal.github.io/projects/xray-classif_EDA/).

```bash

kedro new
Project Name:
=============
Please enter a human readable name for your new project.
Spaces and punctuation are allowed.
 [New Kedro Project]: pneumothorax

Repository Name:
================
Please enter a directory name for your new project repository.
Alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended.
 [pneumothorax]: 

Python Package Name:
====================
Please enter a valid Python package name for your project package.
Alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended. Package name must start with a letter or underscore.
 [pneumothorax]: 

Generate Example Pipeline:
==========================
Do you want to generate an example pipeline in your project?
Good for first-time users. (default=N)
 [y/N]: 

Change directory to the project generated in /home/tdenimal/Dev/pneumothorax

A best-practice setup includes initialising git and creating a virtual environment before running `kedro install` to install project-specific dependencies. Refer to the Kedro documentation: https://kedro.readthedocs.io/


```

# GIT init 

As a best practice, you should add your newly created project directory to git right after creation:

```bash

cd pneumothorax

git init

git add --all

git commit
```

If you are a github user, you can create a repository with the same name on github and then push your local git.


First, you will need to add an ssh public key to your github profile.

You can generate a ssh key pair using

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Then retrieve you public key from default location:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy/paste the content of the .pub file to [your github profile](https://github.com/settings/keys)


Using this method, you will no longer need to submit your password each time you push your code to github.

Then push your code to github:

Just replace **username** with your github username.

```bash

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/${PWD##*/}

git push -u origin master
```





# Defining Data pipeline

Our pipeline is using DICOMDataSet, to be able to read DICOM files and extract ImageDataSet and CSVDataSet from it. DICOMDataSet is a custom Kedro DataSet, you can see how it was created in the [following article](https://tdenimal.github.io/projects/kedro_custom_dataset/)
