In the following article, i will show how to install and use [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro), an open source Python library that will simplify and clarify the way to define data pipelines for your projects. 

Then we will create a project and a custom kedro dataset 
 

# Install kedro

First create a new  conda virtual environment :
kedro is compatible with python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 versions. Here i choosed 3.7.
```bash
conda create -n kedro_project python=3.7
```

Then activate it
```bash
conda activate kedro_project
```

Install kedro from conda-forge repository:


```bash
conda install -c conda-forge kedro
```

Install also kedro-viz plugin, very usefull to display your data pipelines:

## Install kedro-viz plugin

```bash
pip install kedro-viz
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kedro info

 _            _
| | _____  __| |_ __ ___
| |/ / _ \/ _` | '__/ _ \
|   <  __/ (_| | | | (_) |
|_|\_\___|\__,_|_|  \___/
v0.16.2

kedro allows teams to create analytics
projects. It is developed as part of
the Kedro initiative at QuantumBlack.

Installed plugins:
kedro_viz: 3.4.0 (hooks:global,line_magic)

```

# Create your Data Science project

We are going to create our datascience project directory using Kedro. It will initialize all the needed directories using a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template.

First go to the directory where you're used to create your projects repos ( mine is /home/tdenimal/Dev )

```bash
cd /home/tdenimal/Dev
```

Then create project and choose the project name,  leave the other choices at their default value.
I choosed pneumothorax, to create the project directory for the [following work](https://tdenimal.github.io/projects/xray-classif_EDA/).

```bash

kedro new
Project Name:
=============
Please enter a human readable name for your new project.
Spaces and punctuation are allowed.
 [New Kedro Project]: pneumothorax

Repository Name:
================
Please enter a directory name for your new project repository.
Alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended.
 [pneumothorax]: 

Python Package Name:
====================
Please enter a valid Python package name for your project package.
Alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed.
Lowercase is recommended. Package name must start with a letter or underscore.
 [pneumothorax]: 

Generate Example Pipeline:
==========================
Do you want to generate an example pipeline in your project?
Good for first-time users. (default=N)
 [y/N]: 

Change directory to the project generated in /home/tdenimal/Dev/pneumothorax

A best-practice setup includes initialising git and creating a virtual environment before running `kedro install` to install project-specific dependencies. Refer to the Kedro documentation: https://kedro.readthedocs.io/
