To goal here is to use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. 
The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. 

The project will be divided in 2 parts, in part 1 ( this one ), we will make an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand better the different datasets.In part 2, we will define different models for the 28 days forecast horizon target.
