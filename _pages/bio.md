From 2000 to 2005 i studied computer science, earning successively a

Master's degree with a specialization in network and systems infrastructure administration.

After my Master's degree graduation, i decided to move to Paris, the best place to acquire significative experience. From 2005 to 2008, i worked as a Systems engineer at Orange Business Services. I was mainly involved in IT Infrastructure Monitoring Systems projects for  major French companies including SFR ( French mobile communications company ), RATP (public transport operator and maintainer for bus and subways in Paris ), La Poste (postal service company) ....

# 2017 - : Digital transformation and career shift to data science

In early 2017, Lyreco decided to launch his digital transformation and i was involved, due to my database expertise, in the POC of new Big Data tools : Hadoop (Hortonworks), Spark, Vertica DB... It was at that time that i really discovered the Big Data Ecosystem and also the new roles of Data Scientist and Data engineer.

At that time, i was looking for a way to be more close to the business
