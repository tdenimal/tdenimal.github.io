Welcome to my DataScience portfolio. <br>
My name is Thomas, currently working at [Lyreco](https://www.lyreco.com/). 
<br>

---

I earned a Master's Degree in Computer science from the [University of LILLE](https://www.univ-lille.fr/home/) (2005) and a Post-Master's Degree in DataScience from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/post-masters-degree/all-post-masters-degree) (2019). 
<br> 
I have been working as a DBA from 2005 to 2017 and thus i have a strong experience on SGBD, Unix OS and ITOps in general.

As a Data Scientist, i am eager to learn new things everyday, reading new publications from [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) or news/articles from [medium](https://medium.com/topic/data-science).
<br>
In this portfolio, i would like to share my past/current DataScience/ML Engineering projects. 
<br>
Feel free to contact me for any questions/feedbacks.
